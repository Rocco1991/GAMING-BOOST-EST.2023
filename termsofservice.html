            <h3> Terms of Service (READ FIRST!) </h3>
            <br>
            <p>The current Agreement regulates the relations between a Customer and the Contractor regarding the ingame services provided by the Contractor. By placing an order accordingly to this Agreement, the Customer confirms his approval and acceptance
                of the Terms of Agreement.</p>
            <br>
            <h3> 1. Concepts </h3>
            <br>
            <p> 1.1. The Contractor — GamingBoost.com online store, which provides The Services according to the Agreement
                <br> 1.2. The Customer — an individual interested in purchasing of The Service
                <br> 1.3. The Game — an interactive online PC videogame
                <br> 1.4. The Contractor’s site — Contractor’s website, hosted on a domain https://GamingBoost.com
                <br> 1.5. The Service — educational process between the Contractor and the Customer in The Game in order to improve the Customer’s skills, confidence and experience. A full list of services and their detailed descriptions are available
                in the Contractor’s website.</p>
            <br>
            <h3> 2. Process of placing an order and obtainment of the services </h3>
            <br>

            <p> 2.1. The Customer is obliged to carefully examine the Agreement and other rules and instructions, concerning The Service provided by the Contractor (they are published in The Contractor’s site).<br> 2.2. To place an order the Customer chooses
                the required service using a special webform in the Contractor’s site and fills all fields that are specified as necessary. These fields include the vital information needed to proceed with the service by the Contractor. The Contractor
                may change the specified terms only if that does not prejudice any of the Customer’s interests and does not bring any extra expenses to him. Considering the terms that were not discussed with the Customer, the Contractor may act upon his
                own discretion.<br> 2.3. By sending the filled form to the Contractor, the Customer gives unconditional agreement on total compliance of the Agreement and other conditions of the deal, which were chosen by the Customer in the web-form
                (nature and size of the services etc.).<br> 2.4. The Contractor is obliged to complete the necessary actions to fulfil the Agreement in reasonable terms. Usually, the Contractor specifies default completion time for specific order on the
                Contractor’s site.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3> 3. Refund policy and cancellations </h3>
            <br>
            <p>3.1. If the Contractor did not manage to complete the order placed by the Customer in the specified time terms, the Customer may demand a refund, or the Contractor may refund the money in his own discretion.
                <br> 3.2. The Customer has the right to cancel his order and ask the Contractor for a full refund any time before the start of the service.
                <br> 3.3. The Customer may cancel his order and refuse to continue to receive the services. The amount of the refund will be calculated by the formula: the volume of service that had to be done minus the volume of service that had been
                done at the moment of opening of a dispute or a refusal by the Customer to continue to receive services.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3> 4. Other conditions </h3>
            <br>
            <p>4.1. The messages, sent from the e-mails of both parties appear as documents, written in a simple form and signed by a specific party, and they are an analogue of the valid signature. The parties agree that such documents (messages) will be
                valid without any additional confirmations or registrations (and not requiring autographic signing), only if the other is not directly specified on the Contractor’s site.
                <br> 4.2. The Customer agrees that all screenshots which were made during the service may be used as evidence in case disputes occur in future.</p>
            <br>
            <h3> Changes To This Agreement </h3>
            <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms and Conditions by posting the updated terms on the website.</p>
